# DreamToThePast

Our hero wakes up in a world where he must fight endlessly against foes and villain in order to obtain the memoirs that make up Hyruleâ€™s hard-fought history. Princess Zelda is one of many prisoners locked up in the evil lord Ganon, where Link will have to venture in order to pursue his mission. But worry not that may all of this be just a dream.

The Legend of Zelda: A dream to the Past is our take on the classic TLoZ: A link to the Past, where the core of the game will shift towards a more fast-paced, crammed with action style of game while maintaining the essence that makes TLoZ game. Fans as we are of roguelike games such as The Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon , Roguelight and many more, we feel that the pace that TLoZ games can be pumped up a little bit in order to appeal to a different, more action driven demographic.
